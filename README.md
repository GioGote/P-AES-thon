# P-AES-thon: An AES Python Messaage Encrypter

This project is to demonstrate a simple
yet effective message encrypter. It allows
users to send encrypted messages that require
a key to be successfully decrypted.

PLANS FOR FUTURE:
Incorporate the Django-framework to share
encrypted messages over a web app that can only
be decrypted by web app user recipients
